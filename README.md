# Constrained-DNE
High-efficient extraction of drainage networks from digital elevation model data constrained by enhanced flow enforcement from known river maps

This program is used for drainage network extraction from DEM data, based on the least-cost-search algorithm realized using a size-balanced-binary-tree (see the reference below) to speed-up computation, improved with a channel head recognition method using a geomorphologic change point detection algorithm (which is pursuing pulication in the journal of Computers & Geosciences) to provide an alternative for the existing Critical-Sourcing-Area (CSA) method.
